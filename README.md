# Computer-Vision-Assignments
These include the assignments completed for the course _Computer Vision_ under [Prof Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/)
1) **_Assignment 1: Lines/Edge detection_** <br>
[more](Assignment%201/problem_statement.pdf).
   - Highlighted the medial axis of the moving object in the video clips given using OpenCVâ€™s inbuilt operations.
   - Used openCV operations to clean the image.
   - Detected lines using hough line transform.
   - Detailed [Report](Assignment%201/README.md)
2)  **_Assignment 2: Panaroma creation_** <br>
[more](Assignment%202/problem_statement.pdf).
    - Generated a panoramic image by stitching together multiple images of a scene.
    - Detected key points/features using *SIFT* feature detection.
    - Developed a heuristic to select the best possible image to project the other images on.
    - The images were blended using the distance version of alpha blending.
    - Detailed [Report](Assignment%202/Assignment%202.pdf).
3) **_Assignment 3: Augmented reality application_** </br>
[more](Assignment%203/problem_statement.pdf).
    - Calibrated our webcam using multiple images of a chessboard.
    - Projected a *3-D* model on a predefined marker.
    - Also moved the projected *3-D* model from one marker to another in *3-D* space.
    - Detailed [Report](Assignment%203/Assignment3.pdf).
4) **_Assignment 4: Camera based music player controller_** </br>
[more](Assignment%204/problem_statement.pdf).
    - Trained a neural network to identify different gestures. 
    - Detailed [Report](Assignment%203/Report4(1).pdf).
#### Note
All the assignments have been built using python 3.7.0 and OpenCV.
